# Instructor Groups

The Instructor Groups module in Ilios allows for the creation of reusable and trackable sets of instructors that can be associated to course/session activity. The groups are populated from the existing directory of active Ilios users, and can be modified and added to as needed. An instructor may be associated with any number of instructor groups, or none at all. Instructors and instructor groups are associated with course content at the offering level for each session (session offering(s)).
