Competencies are configured at the School level in Ilios but assigned at the Program Year level. They are in read-only mode at the Course level. The screen shot for this along with links and more discussion will be coming soon.

These commpetencies are set up at the program year level. The list at the course level displays all of those competencies that have been mapped via `course objective >> program year objective` mapping. The program year objectives have been mapped to school competencies or else the competencies would not appear on this list.
