# Edit Offering

### Edit From Offering Editor

To edit attributes of an existing offering, the steps shown below can be followed.

* First select a Course
* When the list of Sessions is displayed, click on the name of the Session that contains offering(s) you want to review and / or modify.
* Ilios brings up the details of the Session.
* Scroll to bottom of the Session details.
* Click the Check Box to edit as shown below.

Ilios opens the Offering up into an edit mode to allow applicable Offering attributes to be modified. An upcoming screen shot will pore over the details. For now, please refer to the previous chapters in this Offerings section. The editing of an Offering is similar (as far as the fields go) to the creation of a new Offering.

After clicking the Edit button under the Action menu as shown above, a screen similar to the following appears with the ability to modify the following Offering attributes.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Any valid Ilios user can now be added as an Instructor. This includes students and non-students. Selecting an Ilios user as "Instructor" effectively adds the Instructor (as well as setting the "Perform Non-Learners" value to "Yes") role to this user's profile.

### Add URL - Virtual Session Link

To add a URL (Virtual Session Link), the URL can be generated using an application such as Zoom and pasted into llios.&#x20;

The URL field is available on the Offerings Editor form directly below Offering Start / End Time. Initially the field appears as shown below.

Clicking into the URL field itself yields the following result.

The value "https://" is highlighted initially. This can be removed by deleting in one keyboard stroke since it is highlighted and selected or the URL can be pasted directly on top of it (replacing it).

After pasting directly on top of the initial value yields the following results.

All that is left to do now is update the offering with this newly added information.

Now that this has been added, the link that was pasted into the URL fields gets converted (for display and usability purposes) to "Virtual Session Link". There is also a "Copy" link if it is desired to have the full URL available for pasting or re-posting elsewhere.&#x20;

### Inline Editing Options

It is also possible and often desirable to edit one or more Offerings directly from Courses and Sessions >> Session List.

An example of this will be inserted here. For now, keep in mind many edits can be made directly from the Session list in Courses and Sessions. Simply expand the session which contains the offerings that you wish to edit. Screen shots of this will be linked or added here soon.
