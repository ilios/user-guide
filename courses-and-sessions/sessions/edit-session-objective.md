## Add MeSH / Vocabulary Terms

Since the process of adding MeSH and / or Vocabulary Terms to a Session objective is identical to how it is accomplished at the Course objective level, please refer to the following links for reference.

[Add MeSH Terms](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/courses/course_objectives/edit-objective#attach-mesh-term-s)

[Add Vocabulary Terms](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/courses/course_objectives/edit-objective#add-vocabulary-term-s)

A quick screen shot of how this looks at the Session Objective level is shown below for reference.
