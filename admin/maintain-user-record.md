# Maintain User Record

With the advent of Ilios 3.0, more user record information modification and maintenance can be performed using the application than ever before.

### Search for and Find User Record to Modify

You can perform a search and select an existing Ilios user record to modify as shown below.

 Now that the user has been selected there are many useful utilities provided by the interface.

As indicated by the arrows in the screen shot below, there are three editing panels along with the calendar feed Web Link area. Each of these four areas are controlled or activated using the buttons indicated.

## Edit User Account Settings

Now the that user account has been selected for modification, many of the text fields can be modified. At UCSF, the Middle Name, Other ID, Phone, and Preferred Email fields can be modified manually. The other field values are brought in from the Campus Directory after clicking the Sync button.

 The permissions/fields that can be selected or un-selected \(meaning yes or no\) are ...

### Course Director \(Non-Student User Role\):

This user becomes selectable as a Course Director. These users will also have access to all areas of Ilios with the exception of the Admin Console and Curriculum Inventory.

### Instructor \(Non-Student User Role\):

This user can be assigned as an Instructor at the Session Offering level. These users will also have access to all areas of Ilios with the exception of the Admin Console and Curriculum Inventory.

### Developer \(Non-Student User Role\):

This is the most powerful user role in Ilios. These users have full control of the system and access to the Admin Console.

### Former Student \(Student Role\):

This gets flagged when a Student has graduated. It can be set manually if desired.

### Account Enabled \(Any User\):

If this is not selected, the user will not be able to log in.

### Exclude From Sync \(Any User\):

If you would prefer to keep the user account settings as they are \(alternate email address etc.\) and do not want to receive updates from the Campus Directory, this should be selected.

### Edit Primary and / or Secondary Cohort Assignments

After clicking as shown below, the Cohort Assignment tool becomes available for use.
