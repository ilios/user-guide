# Teaching Reminders

### Teaching Reminders

These are email messages sent out \(as configured at UCSF\) so that all instructors receive the reminder 7 days prior to the teaching event.

The [email template](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/additional-information/alert-and-email-templates) can be modified to meet your school's needs.

Below is a screen shot roughly showing what a teaching reminder might look like to an instructor. It includes Learner information \(Groups and/or Individuals\) assigned to the Offering.
