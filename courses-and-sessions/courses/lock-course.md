# Lock Course

When an Academic Year is over and a Course should no longer be modified, it is advisable to lock these Courses. No changes can be made to a Course that has been locked.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:  Locked courses can still be rolled over.

Clicking on the Course again to review the details indicates every Course-related detail is now in read-only mode and cannot be modified as long as the Course is locked.
