In the case of searching for MeSH, it is necessary to hit the Enter key on the keyboard to run the search. This is because there is a large data set of MeSH terms so it is necessary to run a special query in this manner.

In the example below, a search was performed for 'helmet'. The results of this query are listed. `Head Protective Devices` is selected.

Once confirmed in the step shown above, the Manage MeSH functional area closes (collapses) back up. If you need to make further additions or removals from Session MeSH terms, click Manage MeSH and repeat these steps. To remove a MeSH Terms, simply click on it to remove it and then confirm the delete action by saving the data.
