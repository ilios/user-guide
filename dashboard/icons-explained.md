This is a zoomed-in close up of the image that appears on the Event Detail screen. Clicking on this image will route the user to [Materials View](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/materials-view) where all learning materials pertaining to this student can be retrieved and/or viewed. The course drop-down will have the current course selected. The current course refers to the one pertaining to the current session.

**TIP:** Select "All Courses" from the drop-down if it is desired to see all materials from all courses. 

Here it is below in a bit better context on the [Event Detail](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/event-detail-view) screen.

### Name Record Icons
![campus name of record](../images/icons_explained/campus_name.png)

The above icon appears if the campus name of record is different from the Ilios user name. See below for more information.

**NOTE**: Mousing over the informational icon as it pertains to user name will provide the campus name of record. An example is shown below (from the Admin Console) after pulling up the user record. The user's name was originally "Nicholas Ann Gutierrez" rather than what it currently is in Ilios "Dabney Gutierrez".

### Pre-work attached
Sessions can't be deleted when this is the case since more than one other session depends on the existence of this one.

### Unpublished Offering
The icon below is displayed on the Calendar when an offering has not yet been published. Only Ilios users with non-student user roles will see these on the Calendar. Students only see published offerings. These have been thought of in the past as having been in "Draft" status.
