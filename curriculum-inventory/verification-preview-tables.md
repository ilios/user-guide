# Verification Preview Tables

Ilios now includes a major improvement to the Curriculum Inventory toolset. Now as you build your report, you will be able to review your data compiled to reflect the primary tables of the CI Verification Report -- which in turn reflect the DCI \(Data Collection Instrument\) tables you will use to support your LCME Site Visit. 

All 8 tables will be previewed and demonstrated here.
