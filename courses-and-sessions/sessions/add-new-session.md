## Independent Learning Modules

A Session may also be saved as an Independent Learning Module (ILM), created with an estimated number of educational hours rather than a calendar-based date and time. To create such a session, select the “independent learning” check-box, and enter the associated number of educational hours, a "due-by" date, Description. Learner Groups and Instructors can be added by clicking the "Manage Learner Groups" button.

ILM's can also be created as a pre-requisite for an upcoming session. Click [here](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/sessions/independent-learning-module-ilm) for more information on ILM's.
