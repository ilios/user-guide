You can view this in Finder \(Apple\) or Windows Explorer \(WIndows\) and save it to a more appropriate location of your chosing. Later, right click on it and choose to open it however you would normally open a .csv file. Excel or other text or spreadsheet applications should work.

What I recommend ...

* Bold and customize the field names \(top row\)
* Make the "mapped\_course\_objective" field much wider
* Once widened, use Align text / "word wrap" on the "mapped\_course\_objective" field
* Fix the top row so the file can ben scrolled.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** _****_These Program Years are based on Matriculation Year so if the year selected is 17-18 for example, the mappings are probably not complete yet for the later years of these students' educational experience. This is because the mappings may have not been completed yet in Ilios for Courses, Sessions, and Offerings which are scheduled to take place in the future.
