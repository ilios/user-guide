# MeSH

Ilios has an incorporated a version of the searchable MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) thesaurus maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, to allow the tagging of various levels of curricular data with appropriate (shareable) vocabulary.

[MeSH Terms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) can be added to any of the following curricular objects within Ilios.

* Course
* [Course Objective](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/additional-information/mesh/add-mesh-to-course-objective)
* Session
* [Session Objective](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/additional-information/mesh/add-mesh-to-session-objective)
* Program Year Objective
* Learning Material

The section of the guide covers the addition of MeSH to a course objective as well as a session objective; but the process is similar for any MeSH association.
