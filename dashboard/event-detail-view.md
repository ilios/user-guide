# Event Detail

The Event Detail view is reached when a user clicks on a link in their Calendar, Calendar feed, Week at a Glance (WaaG), or any part of Ilios that reaches user Events (published Offerings).

The screen shot below starts the process for a student to access the Event Detail view. In this case, the Session selected is a pre-requisite (formerly know as Pre-work) ILM due before "Response of the Heart to Injury".

**Learning Material Activity Check Boxes**

These are used by Learners (students) to track their progress as far as reading, viewing, or other activities related to Learning Materials for any given Session. Clicking one time will change (toggle) the check box to the next state. There are four states. 

**1.** Not Started - This is the default indicating that the student has not started reading, viewing, or performing the action of completing the assignment as it pertains to the Learning Material attached to an assigned Session.

**2.** In Progress - This is the result of clicking one time after the previous state. This means the student is working on completing the Learning Material assignment.

**4.** Not Available - In this case, the user will need to navigate to another location to both download / view the Learning Material and to ude the check box to track progress. It is necessary to drill into pre-work or "Due Before" linked Sessions to get to the Learning Material itself and to be able to utilize the check boxes. They will not be enabled from the top level (post-requisite / target) Session.

These activity check boxes will retain their state for the current user wherever they navigate to in Ilios that relates to Learning Materials.
