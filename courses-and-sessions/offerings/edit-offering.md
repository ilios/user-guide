# Edit Offering

To edit attributes of an existing offering, the steps shown below can be followed.

* First select a Course
* When the list of Sessions is displayed, click on the name of the Session that contains offering\(s\) you want to review and / or modify.
* Ilios brings up the details of the Session.
* Scroll to bottom of the Session details.
* Click the Check Box to edit as shown below.

Ilios opens the Offering up into an edit mode to allow applicable Offering attributes to be modified. An upcoming screen shot will pore over the details. For now, please refer to the previous chapters in this Offerings section. The editing of an Offering is similar \(as far as the fields go\) to the creation of a new Offering.

After clicking the Edit button under the Action menu as shown above, a screen similar to the following appears with the ability to modify the following Offering attributes.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Any valid Ilios user can now be added as an Instructor. This includes students and non-students. Selecting an Ilios user as "Instructor" effectively adds the Instructor \(as well as setting the "Perform Non-Learners" value to "Yes"\) role to this user's profile.
