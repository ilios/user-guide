# Course Leadership

### Course Leadership

Course Leadership is part of the new permissions model. Course Directors and Course Administrators are added here. Both of these user roles have the same rights - to maintain any and all aspects of this Course. It is a matter of specifying whether the user is an administrative user using Ilios to maintain the Course or if the user is actually a Director. 

Refer to the [permissions matrix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/431sdj2bfoi3v1f/Ilios%20New%20Default%20Permissions%20Matrix.pdf?dl=0) for more information on these updated permissions. After exposing the Course Details, Course Leadership is the next functional area below the Course Summary Details section.

For the sake of demonstration, I will remove "Juan B. Bowman" and put him in his correct categorization as a Course Administrator and not as a Course Director. He will have the same rights as a Director but for reporting and analytical purposes, his role is more administrative in nature so this designation is more accurate.

**Steps taken** **...**

* Removed "Juan B. Bowman" by clicking as shown above.
* Performed a search on the right side text box for "Juan".
* Select the correct user.

The pre-save screen appears as shown below.

This displays the contracted Course Leadership area in the context of the larger Course Details reflecting the updated counts but hiding the details.
