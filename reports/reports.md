## Run Saved Report

Reports now live in their own large area rather than the compact My Reports of yesteryear. This allows for better visibility of results as well as inclusion of data tables and legends.

This shows a typical user's saved reports.

![Saved reports](../images/reports/saved_reports_start.png)

Running any of the reports here is as easy as simply clicking on the link. This is shown below.

![Run any report](../images/reports/run_selected_report.png)

After clicking as shown above, the screen will refresh with the data outputted to the screen. 

![Data displayed](../images/reports/report_data_displayed.png)

As shown above, there is a link available to download the report's output. After clicking as shown above (on a Mac anyway), the report file (.csv) is named automatically and saved in the user's "Downloads" folder.

![Download action shown](../images/reports/report_downloaded.png)

In this report example, the .csv download includes the following fields ...

* Session Title 
* Course Title 
* Academic Year
* Session Description
* Session Objective (one per row)

You can use a spreadsheet program (Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers etc.) of your choice to set up formatting and sort order of this exported output.

## Create New Report

It is now possible to run an "on the fly" report. You can choose to save it for future use or use it as a one-off report, opting to download the data or not.

Creating a new report can be easily done using the guidelines shown below. The choice of whether to save the report or not is made after selecting the report's output.

After clicking as shown above, the screen appears similar to the following screen shot. This only shows the first of several drop-down options to be choosing for new reports (to be saved or not).

### Top-level Reporting Options

The following options are available at this top level (after choosing School) ...

* Courses (currently selected as default)
* Sessions
* Programs
* Program Years
* Instructors
* Instructor Groups
* Learning Materials
* Competencies
* MeSH Terms
* Terms
* Session Types

The information being presented below will vary depending on which of these top-level reporting objects you select. The subsequent drop-downs are content driven in the sense that they will vary based on selection here.

Choose "Sessions" as the next selection option. This will ensure to retrieve a list of sessions that meet the speicifcations being selected.

![choose sessions as report option](../images/reports/sessions_chosen.png)

After choosing the value "Sessions" as shown above, we are now ready to select the next reporting option. 

### Second Level Options

The available options for drilling down below "Session" are ...

* Anything (gives all sessions for specified school)
* Course
* Program 
* Instructors
* Instructor Groups
* Learning Material
* Competency
* MeSH Term
* Session Type
* Term

We will continue on to specify the data set we'd like to review. The screen refreshes as shown below after making the selection of "Term".

It is worth keeping in mind that any school can have a number of different Vocabularies set up to be chosen under "Terms". In this case, we are selecting from the Vocabulary "Topics". The value chosen in this example is "Anatomy".

![choose Topics > Anatomy as report option](../images/reports/anatomy_chosen.png)

## New Report Options

As shown in the previous steps, we have decided to run a Term based report which will display all Sessions assoicated with the Topic of "Anatomy". It can now be run immediately (and downloaded) or saved to run at any point in the future. Reports that are believed to be generally useful and informative throughout time should be saved, whereas one-off ad hoc style reports can be immediately run and not saved. Below is the screen showing these two options at this juncture.

### Ad-hoc / View Only

This workflow allows the useru to view and / or download the data from a newly created report but not save it for future use. This would be for situations when the data is only needed this one time.

### Save Report

Under the same scenario as above, a report can be saved and run at any point in the future. The steps for running this type of reports are covered at the top of this page. This is helpful when the data continues to be useful over time.
