## Student-Only View 

The screen shot below shows what a typical student would see after clicking "Calendar" from the Dashboard. "My Schedule" is the default when any Ilios user accesses the Calendar. This student has not been assigned any teaching or administrative roles in Ilios yet. If their record were to be retrieved from the Admin Console by a user with more advanced privileges, the "Performs Non-Learner Functions" would be set to "No" by the system. They do not see the Ilios flyout menu or the Event View Settings toolbar until they have been assigned non-learner activities in Ilios.

## Event Context Buttons

This toolbar appears for Ilios users who are involved with activities other than learning. This includes being attached as an instructor to offerings or ILM's, as an administrator or director of a course, or administrator of one or more sessions. The toolbar containing these event context buttons is shown below with the "Admin" button selected.
