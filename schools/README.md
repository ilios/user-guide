# Schools

Selecting Schools from the Ilios flyout menu takes the user to a location which lists all of the Schools of the entire University that are using Ilios.

## Initial School Attributes

These are set only at the time of creating a School for use in Ilios. There are only two fields that are set at School creation time.

* **Title**: The Title of the School \(ie Medicine\) is set at creation time. This can be modified later.
* **Administrator Email**: This is currently set at creation time as well. It will be added as a configurable item in the interface but is not available for modification yet.
