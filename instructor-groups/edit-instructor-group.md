Once the Instructor Group has been selected, the screen appears as shown below. The arrows point to actions that can be performed.

**NOTE**: The trash can icon is enabled because this Instructor Group has not been associated with any teaching activities. The "Associated Courses" field provides this information. If that number is greater than zero, the trash can delete button will be disabled.
