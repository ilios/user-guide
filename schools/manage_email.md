# Manage Email

## Administrator

This email address is required when setting up a school initially. It can be modified after creation but can only contain one record.

## Change-alert Recipients

One or more (in this case) recipients can be added to any school at any time. This is an optional field but can be very useful when tracking down any potential issues regarding automated teaching reminders which are received by instructors seven (or other duration if preferred) days before a scheduled teaching event.
