# Edit Program Year

There are many things that can edited for any given Program Year. Since Program Years can be rolled over, you can roll Program Year over and then make additional changes to the newly created Program Year. The options are detailed below.

To start with, navigate to Programs and select a Program. In this case, "Doctor of Medicine - BRIDGES" has been selected.

## Select Program Year

For this example, and in order to show more detail in upcoming steps, Matriculation Year "2021-2022" with the Cohort of "Class of 2025" has been selected. At the time of this edit, those students will have recently graduated. This is useful in detailing Competency use throughout the student's educational trajectory. They will have already learned the Topics and Competencies on offer in the Program. Reporting out will provide more robust results.

![select program year](../images/programs/program_years/select_program_year.png)

Here is the resulting display after selecting "Class of 2025" as the Program Year. Editing a Program Year means utilizing the navigation shown below.

The competencies associated with this program year are now listed. The button "Manage Competencies" should be clicked to review the mapping and make any changes. 

In the "competencies listed" image above, a total of 7 competencies appear. All of these are at the same level - the school competency level. We will see this in the screen shot below where none of the sub-domains of these higher level competencies have been selected for use in this program year - Class of 2025. Those are the lower level values that have not been selected.

### Select Competencies

For the sake of demonstration, we are going to add all three sub-domains that pertain to the school competency "Interpersonal & Communication Skills" to the Class of 2025 program year competency framework. Any of these three sub-domains can now be used to further differentiate and specify the expetise needed to graduate as a member of this class.
