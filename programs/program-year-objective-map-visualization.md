# Program Year Objective Visualization

This is a very dense and detailed visualizsation showing program year objectives being mapped down to the course and session level, indicating how this mapping has occured.

It may be helpful to select a matriculation year with a considerable amount of data with a graduation year close to current year. This will help reflect the full curriculum in detail.
