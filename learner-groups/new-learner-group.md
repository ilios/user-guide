After clicking "Done", the new learner group is added to the appropriate list (shown below). The list is sorted initially by title in alphabetical order. The sort order can be changed by the user to be Member or Subgroup counts instead of title. The new learner group "Reasoning and Thought" has been added with no students included. They can be added later of course.

**NOTE**: This newly added Learner Group can still be deleted since it has not been attached to any Offerings yet.

The new learner group detail screen appears as shown below. Sub groups can added to any group (even another sub group) as shown in the [Sub Groups](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/learner-groups/sub-groups) section.
