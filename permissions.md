# Permissions

Ilios uses this [permissions model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/431sdj2bfoi3v1f/Ilios%20New%20Default%20Permissions%20Matrix.pdf?dl=0), which replaces and enhances the permissions tools and role assignments previously available in Ilios.

This shift impacts how users are able to interact with Ilios data as administrators.

**WHAT THIS MEANS**: Your administrative users have permissions to edit only the areas to which they have been explicitly granted permissions. Every school, program, program year, course, and session (as well as the deprecated Curriculum Inventory reports) has a section for the addition of Directors, and/or Administrators, and/or Student Advisors, which assigns them the appropriate usage permissions for a user at that level (as seen in the [permissions matrix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/431sdj2bfoi3v1f/Ilios%20New%20Default%20Permissions%20Matrix.pdf?dl=0)). Instructors, who can be any Ilios user, assigned to individual teaching activities automatically receive administrative permissions for that activity, regardless of other assignments in the system. The "Performs Non-Learner Functions" flag set will be set to "True" if it has not been set by the system already.

## Setting Permissions

Each section where permissions can be modified is covered in detail in the section of the User Guide that pertains to that functional area of Ilios.

### Roles by Association

It is important to note that any Ilios user can be added to any role. Users who get attached to an offering are automatically added to the "Instructor" role if this has not happened previously. In other words, there is no need to manually add the role to the user's profile. It gets added when used in relation to the user. It's by association to an offering.

## Leadership Links

The following functional areas in Ilios all have a component that gets used to add what is known as "Leadership" to the respective category. Leadership can vary a bit depending on the area in Ilios. The following links contain the steps and details regarding adding Ilios users to "leadership" roles and what that all means in context.
