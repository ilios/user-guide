Attaching and modifying terms (grouped by vocabularies in Ilios) is performed at both the course level as well as at the session level. 

A full section will be here soon but for now refer to term maintenance as performed at the [session](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/sessions/session_actions/edit-session#manage-vocabulary-terms) level. The process is similar if not exactly the same.
