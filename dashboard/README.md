# Dashboard

Once logged in, you will be presented with the “Dashboard” or landing page, which will display the events for the current week for the logged-in user ([Week at a Glance](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/week-at-a-glance)). Initially, the Calendar is not displayed. Clicking the "Calendar" button causes the Calendar to appear instead of Week at a Glance.

The Dashboard is designed to provide quick access to common sets of information and simple task and activity tracking. Navigation is performed by using the Ilios Menu, which appears on the upper left part of the screen and can be accessed and expanded by clicking “Ilios Menu” as shown below. It is a fly away menu that expands once it has been clicked and is available even if you have scrolled down the page. If your screen has enough viewable area, the **Ilios Menu** will appear automatically as shown below. Ilios users who do not perform non-learner activities (i.e. students who are not also Instructors) will not see the Ilios Menu shown below.

### Ilios Menu

#### Large Screen View

The view below is of the Ilios flyout menu on a relatively large screen. This is how it will appear for Admin users unless they use a smaller screen, tablet, or smart phone.

#### Small Screen View - contracted

When the Ilios application is not being viewed at full size or is being viewed using a device with a smaller screen surface area, the toolbar spans across the top of the screen as shown below.

The **Ilios Menu expander** is only available in the smaller view of the toolbar. It is not needed in full-size mode.

#### Small Screen View - expanded

Clicking the Ilios Menu expander (or contractor if already expanded) reveals in more detail the available menu options. You can see this display below.
