# Event Detail

The Event Detail view is reached when a user clicks on a link in their Calendar, Calendar feed, Week At A Glance, or any part of Ilios that reaches user Events \(published Offerings\).

The screen shot below starts the process for a student to access the Event Detail View. In this case, the Session to be viewed in Event Detail View has a Pre-work ILM attached to it. Since these appear at the top of the Week At A Glance, click as shown below to go to correct area of Week at a Glance that corresponds to that Session. This is helpful because the list can be quite lengthy.

After clicking as shown above, the user is routed to the correct location in Week At A Glance for the Session "Gluclose Metabolism and Blood Glucose Homeostasis", which is the follow-up \(post-requisite\) to the ILM entitled "Diabetes Management \(Online Lesson\)". The link we will follow for this demonstration is pointed out below.

* Glucose Cases - This is another Session this Learner is scheduled to attend at 9:10am
