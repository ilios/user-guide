  This is actually for Table 3-A (Non-Clerkship) and Table 3-B (Clerkship).
  Technically it is two distinct tables but is counted as one of the eight.

# Instructional Time

#### Table 3-A

#### Table 3-B

![Clerkship Sequence Blocks](../../.gitbook/assets/ci_table3_2.png)

In both cases, the Verification table returns the Sequence Block title, Academic Level, Total Weeks of instruction, along with the Average Hours of Instruction per week. This is helpful to determine if adjustments should be made before submitting the CI Report.
