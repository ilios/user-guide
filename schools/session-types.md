### De-Activate Session Type

De-activate a Session Type if it is no longer in use. This does not change the legacy data but will result in the Session Type no longer being available for use in Ilios going forward. The controls for performing this action are shown below.

### Remove Session Type

Session Types can only be completely removed from the system if they have never been used. This is shown below. Like basically everywhere in Ilios, if the trash can is enabled, the object can be removed from the system.
