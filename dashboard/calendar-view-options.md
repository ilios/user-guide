# Calendar View Options

Beyond the filtering options mentioned in the previous section, there are three different viewing options for the Calendar. These involve how much data you would like to view at once in terms of duration of time. The Calendar can be viewed based on the following time increments -- **Day, Week, Month**.

The Day, Week, and Month indicators (shown below) are used to switch between these time-based views.

### NOTE ABOUT THE DISPLAY OF MULTIPLE OFFERINGS:

When a Session with multiple offerings is clicked on the Week or Month View, the Day View is displayed to reveal the details.

For a Session with Multiple Offerings, it is important to note that the offerings will be grouped on the Calendar and only displayed once in Week and Month view. The Day view will show all of the Session Offerings on the same screen - as shown below.

**Click the Session with Multiple Offerings**

## Multi-day Events

Events that occur starting on one date and then ending on a later date are displayed below the Calendar. An example will be shown below soon.
