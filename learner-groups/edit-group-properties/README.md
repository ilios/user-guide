# Edit Learner Group

The first step in the editing and review process is to select school, program, and cohort. The drop-down boxes on the top of the screen are used to do this as shown below.

## select school, program, and cohort

The school selector is the first drop-down menu available and visible on the page. It is shown below with Medicine already chosen as the School.

Now that Medicine has been selected, a program "Doctor of Medicine - BRIDGES" has been selected as shown above. The cohort "Class of 2028" has also been selected.

At this level, you can see the following fields ...

* Learner Group Title -- The title for this Learner Group (can be filtered)
* Members -- A count of the total of group and subgroup members
* Subgroups -- A count of all of the subgroups for this higher-level group
* Action menu -- Delete or Copy

### Filter by Group title

The ability to filter by learner group Title makes it easy to find and select a group to modify. Any characters (1 or more) can be entered. The result set is updated to return only Learner Groups that contain that search string in their Learner Group Title.

In this example, the Learner Group and / or Subgroups to be modified is called "SET Class of 2028". Enter "se" (not case-sensitive) in the filter box as shown below.

### Edit Group Membership

**Important Note**: The focus of editing group membership is the group itself rather than any given learner.

The first thing to remember is to always navigate to the Learner Group to which you wish to add or remove Learners.

The list of the learners currently enrolled in this group is shown below.
