# Learner Group Defaults

## Default Location

To specify a default location for a small group offering to take place, the following steps can be taken.

* Select the Learner Group to modify and click "Click to edit" or if there already is a default location, it will be hyperlinked. Clicking on the text value of the default location will open the editing pane.

* After following the step indicated above, the "Click to edit" Default Location field changes into a text box allowing the default location to be entered manually. This is shown below. The default location has been entered for this Learner Group "HSW 322".

* Click the green check box or press Enter on the keyboard to save this specification.

Now that it has been saved, "HSW 322" appears as a clickable hyperlink in case changes need to be made.

## Default Instructor\(s\)

The process for adding default instructor\(s\) is similar with the exception being you can add more than one Instructor or Instructor Group as the default. Screen shots are coming soon to show this.
