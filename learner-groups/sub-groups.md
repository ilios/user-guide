Once added, the newly created sub group \(Demo Sub 1\) appears as shown below. It can be modified by clicking on the Title provided. There are no members in this sub group. They should be added manually. Also, there are no members in the Parent Gruop because the option to create an empty group was selected when it was created. Alternatively, the entire Cohort could be included in the Parent Group \(Demonstration Group\). The sub group that was just created can deleted by clicking on the trash can icon \(under "Actions"\). You will be asked to confirm this action since it cannot be undone.

## Add Multiple Sub Groups

Any number of sub groups can be added automatically as well. The names will increment based on the number of sub groups desired. In this case since the Parent Group is called Demonstration, the sub groups will be named Demonstration 01 through Demonstration 12.
