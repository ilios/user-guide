# Learner Group Defaults

## 

## Default Location

To specify a default location for a small group offering to take place, the following steps can be taken.

* Select the Learner Group to modify and click "Click to edit" or if there already is a default location, it will be hyperlinked. Clicking on the text value of the default location will open the editing pane.

* After following the step indicated above, the "Click to edit" Default Location field changes into a text box allowing the default location to be entered manually. This is shown below. The default location has been entered for this Learner Group "HSW 322".

Now that it has been saved, "HSW 322" appears as a clickable hyperlink in case changes need to be made.

## Default Instructor\(s\)

The process for adding default instructor\(s\) is similar with the exception being you can add more than one Instructor or Instructor Group as the default. Screen shots are coming soon to show this.

## Default Virtual Learning Link

This is used to set a default virtual learning link for this small group. Remote learning has made this important in recent years. The value can be pasted or entered as shown in an updated screen shots shown below.

To finish the process, click the green confirmation button or press enter on the keyboard. Members of "Anatomy Lab Groups 01" will see the default virtual learning link in the offering detail. Every small group offering for this group will obtain these very useful default values.

## Needs Accommodation

This is used when one or more learners in a learner group require accommodations to successfully participate in remote learning activities.

Initially \(before being set\), the toggle appears as shown below. The default for any learner group is "No"

Slide the toggle over to the right by clicking it.

You can review and verify which learner groups have had this value set. Refer to the arrows in the screen shot below.

These groups are subgroups. From the parent group \(one level up\), this is how these designations appear.
