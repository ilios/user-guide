Attaching and modifying terms (grouped by vocabularies in Ilios) is performed at both the course level as well as at the [session](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/sessions/session_actions/edit-session#manage-vocabulary-terms) level. 

# Add Vocabulary Term

For the sake of demonstration, we will start with a course that has not had any vocabulary terms attached at this point.

## Select Course 

The course has been selected (Airways, Blood and Circulation - 2024). The [Edit Course](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/courses/course_actions/edit-course) section has good information about searching for and selecting a course to view/modify.
