# Week At A Glance

This view gives students the detailed information they will need to navigate the current week. This includes all of the offerings they should be attending along with all of the learning materials associated with these offerings. Pre-work activities and Independent Learning Modules (asynchronous learning activities) are also included.

This is the default when a user logs in. As shown below, there are [Event Detail](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/event-detail-view) and [Learning Material](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/materials-view) links available as well. A scroll bar will be displayed if the information does not all fit on the screen.

**NOTE**: Week At A Glance (WaaG) is not designed as a complete and full calendar. It contains confirmed learning activities the learner will be facing that week. To access other weeks in a similarly formatted view, [All Weeks](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/week-at-a-glance#all-weeks) can be accessed. Events that are set to a status of "Scheduled", which don't contain session specific information and event scheduling are **NOT** displayed on Week at a Glance. They are available on "Activities" and "Calendar" view.&#x20;

## **Pre-work**

This section appears at the top of Week at a Glance. If a student has Independent Learning Modules assigned to them that have been linked to upcoming Session Offerings that pertain to their schedule, these are listed at the top of the screen. They are ordered by the date / time of the upcoming Offerings. This is designed to make it easier for students to plan their approach towards tackling these pre-requisites before arriving in class.

In situations where linked ILM's are assigned, the user can navigate to either the ILM that needs to be completed before the scheduled Offering or to the Event Detail screen of the Offering itself. Standard ILM's which have a Due Date will show up on the Week At A Glance displaying the associated Due Date. This type of ILM is **NOT** provided its own area. The ILM's are ordered with the rest of the student's Offerings in ascending chronological date and time order.

## All Weeks

Another great feature of Ilios is that you can review any week's activity, whether it is in the future or the past. This also allows the user to refer to Learning activities that occurred or will occur in any week of any year that the user chooses to select. To open this functionality, click as shown in the screen shot below.&#x20;

Any number of weeks can be expanded or contracted to show or hide all details of the events taking place in that week. This is demonstrated below. The links to Learning Materials and Session Details are also highlighted in the screen shot.
