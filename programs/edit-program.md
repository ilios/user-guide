![select new duration](../images/programs/edit_program/select_new_duration.png)

## Update Leadership

Please refer to the [Permissions Matrix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/431sdj2bfoi3v1f/Ilios%20New%20Default%20Permissions%20Matrix.pdf?dl=0) to review what rights within the Ilios system will be granted when users are added as Program Directors.

![expand leadership](../images/programs/edit_program/expand_leadership.png)

![click to manage](../images/programs/edit_program/click_to_manage.png)

After clicking as shown above, the screen allows for the searching and selecting of any Ilios user to be added as program director (Leaderdship).

![select to add to leadership](../images/programs/edit_program/select_to_add_to_leadership.png)

![confirm new leadership](../images/programs/edit_program/confirm_new_leadership.png)

Following the "process this update" step as shown above, the results of the previous activity will be saved to the system, successfully updating the program year leadership and adding a program director. Should you choose to follow the "cancel" process shown above, the counter will return to "0" and the search box for Directors will clear out. The program leadership, under this scenario, will not be updated.

This is still in expanded mode. In contracted mode, the count will still update to reflect this recent action if the save gets confirmed.
