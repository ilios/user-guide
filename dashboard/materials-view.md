# Materials View

With the Materials view, all Learning Materials which have Offerings within the next 60 days are displayed initially. This can be changed to display "[All Materials](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/materials-view#all-materials)" - everything associated with this this student's educational trajectory. It is important to note that if there is no value displayed in the "Session" column, these are Course level materials and do not pertain to any specific session.

**NOTE**: Since this pertains exclusively to "Learning Materials", these materials apply only to Students. Instructors and Course Directors will not see any Learning Materials here.

#### Next 60 Days

Clicking as shown above on "Materials" brings up the Learning Materials the student will be using for the offerings occurring at any point in the next 60 days. "All Materials" can be toggled here which will have the same window but with all Learning Materials the student has ever encountered. Pagination helps load these Learning Materials up quite quickly.

Clicking on the title of the Learning Material will route the user to be able to access and / or download the Learning Material file, link, or citation. If it is a link, the web site will open. Citations are displayed in completeness right there and there is nothing to click or follow. Files will be downloaded to the user's computer.

#### All Materials

Below is a screen shot similar to the one above but this time displaying the student's entire suite of Learning Materials for their entire education experience.
