# Edit Learner Group

The first step in the editing and review process is to select school, program, and cohort. The drop-down boxes on the top of the screen are used to do this as shown below.

## Select School, Program, and Cohort

The school selector is the first drop-down menu available and visible on the page. It is shown below with Medicine already chosen as the School.

Now that Medicine has been selected, a program "Doctor of Medicine - BRIDGES" has been selected as shown above. The cohort "Class of 2028" has also been selected.

At this level, you can see the following fields ...

* Learner Group Title -- The title for this Learner Group (can be filtered)
* Members -- A count of the total of group and subgroup members
* Subgroups -- A count of all of the subgroups for this higher-level group
* Action menu -- Delete or Copy

### Filter by Group Title

The ability to filter by learner group Title makes it easy to find and select a group to modify. Any characters (1 or more) can be entered. The result set is updated to return only Learner Groups that contain that search string in their Learner Group Title.

In this example, the Learner Group and / or Subgroups to be modified is called "SET Class of 2028". Enter "se" (not case-sensitive) in the filter box as shown below.

### Sort Options

In addition to the filtering option explained above, the list of learner groups can be sorted (one sort applied at a time) by "Learner Group Title", "Members", or by "Subgroups".

Learner group titles can be sorted alphabetically ascending or descending whereas member count ("Members") or subgroup count ("Subgroups") can be sorted numerically by an ascending or descending sort.

### Edit Group Attributes

To edit a Group's attributes, click as shown above. The group's name is a hyperlink used to edit it or view its attributes / membership. In this example "SET Class of 2028" has been selected. The top part of the screen appears as shown below with selected features highlighted in the screen shot.
