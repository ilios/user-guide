## Edit Description

This is done in an inline editing style so you don't have to leave the page or lose the continuity of your work. This type of functionality is used in Ilios as much as possible for a more seamless interface experience.

* To maintain MeSH Term\(s\) and / or Vocabulary Terms associated with the Course Objective, follow the actions outlined in the screen shot series and steps detailed in the two upcoming sections below.

## Attach one or more MeSH Terms
