# Activities View

When you want to see more than one week at a time, "Activities" can be selected. This will display all learning activities for the next 60 days. If you wish to view learning activities that may have occurred or will occur at any point in the entire educational experience, [All Weeks](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/week-at-a-glance#all-weeks) can be accessed instead from [Week at A Glance](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/week-at-a-glance). The pre-work learning activities are displayed at the top of the screen. The links will route the user to the corresponding [Event Detail](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/event-detail-view) for the link clicked.

## Activities \(for the next 60 days\)

* Displays all upcoming activities for the logged in user - student or non-student. Either the Date/Time can be clicked or the Room \# can be clicked.  Like always, links have the blue font and the mouse pointer turns to a finger.  You will be taken to the [Event Detail](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/calendar-view#event-detail-view) page upon clicking on one of the "Activities" links.
