A quick reference to MeSH terms is located [here](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/additional-information/mesh).

For the sake of demonstration, the same course as earlier in this section will be used. We have selected the course "Airways, Blood and Circulation" from the academic year 2024-2025 to illustrate the process of associating MeSH terms directly to a course.
