# My Courses

### **My Courses**

This area on the Dashboard displays all upcoming or current Courses associated with the logged-in user - student or non-student. If you are logged in as a user who performs non-learner functions, clicking on the Course Title link will take you to that course's Course Detail page. Students do not get activated links; just informational text displaying their courses.

This is demonstrated below showing how it works while being logged in as an Instructor.

Clicking on the Course Title (Renal, Endocrine, GI, Nutrition) takes the user to the Course Detail screen for the selected Course as shown below.
