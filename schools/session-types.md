# Session Types

This refers to an educational activity's modality. Examples include "Lecture", "Small Group <12", and "Tutorial". These are customizable at the School level.

### Add New Session Type

### De-Activate Session Type

De-activate a Session Type if it is no longer in use. This does not change the legacy data but will result in the Session Type no longer being available for use in Ilios going forward. The controls for performing this action are shown below.

**NOTE:** When a Session Type gets de-activated, it is sent to the bottom of this list. "(disabled)" will appear after the Session Type name.

### Remove Session Type

Session Types can only be completely removed from the system if they have never been used. This is shown below. Like basically everywhere in Ilios, if the trash can is enabled, the object can be removed from the system.
