Leadership is part of the permissions model. At the course level, Directors, Administrators, and Student Advisors are added here. Course **Directors** and **Administrators**  have similar rights - to maintain any and all aspects of this Course. It is a matter of specifying whether the user is an administrative user using Ilios to maintain the Course or if the user is actually a Director. **Student Advisors** are explained below.

# Student Advisors

Users given the role of Student Advisor are able to download any and all Learning Materials from a Course to which they have been given this role. They will need to navigate the Calendar in order to access these resources. In other words, their Week at a Glance, Activities, and calendar feed will NOT contain all of the learning events of their assigned Courses; but the Learning Materials will be available for them to review to assist other students.

Refer to the [permissions matrix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/431sdj2bfoi3v1f/Ilios%20New%20Default%20Permissions%20Matrix.pdf?dl=0) for more information on these updated permissions. After exposing the Course Details, Course Leadership is the next functional area below the Course Summary Details section.

For the sake of demonstration, "Carl Gloria Sanders" will be removed from being a Course Director and will be put their correct categorization as a Course Administrator instead. He will have the same rights as a Director but for reporting and analytical purposes, his role is more administrative in nature so this designation is more accurate.
