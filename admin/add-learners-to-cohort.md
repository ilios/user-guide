# Add Learners to Cohort

Learners who have been added to Ilios but have not been assigned into a Cohort can be added using the Admin Console.

To do this ...

* Pull up the Admin screen
* Click Manage

## Click to Manage

The screen now appears as shown below. It has been determined for three users to be added to the "Doctor of Medicine - BRIDGES Class of 2029" Cohort. Click the Save button to process this request.

## Assign Learners

Once added into the cohort, these students can be placed in learner groups for that cohort or assigned directly to offerings as individual learners. These learner groups get assigned to offerings. Student calendars will get populated by either of these actions provided course and session are both published.

## Create New User

Refer to [Create New User](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/admin/create-new-user) for adding users to a cohort from your school's directory. For institutions not using a directory, students can be added to a Cohort upon setting up the user Account.

## Upload Multiple Users

It is also possible to perform a bulk upload operation for students (learners) or non-learners to be added to Ilios. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This is only available if your institution is not using a directory to populate Ilios with new learners. The "Upload Muliple Users" button will not appear if this functionality is not applicable to your institution's configuration.

### Click to Start

This process is started by clicking as shown below.

These users can be learners who can be assigned to a cohort or non-learners who are added to the system initially with no advanced permissions. They can be assigned to any activity in Ilios, which of course can implicitly provide elevated access.
