# Add MeSH to Session Objective

The process of adding a MeSH term to be associated with a session objective is the same as performing this action on a coure objective.

For the sake of illustration and brevity, this example and documentation will already have the session requiring a MeSH term addition to be selected in Ilios. This process has been covered elsewhere and will be linked here as well.
