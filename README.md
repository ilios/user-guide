## The Official Ilios User Guide

## <mark style="color:blue;">User Guide Search</mark>

To perform a quick search to find any Ilios topic you may be hoping to find, the search box in the upper right portion of the screen can be used for this. Before entering criteria, it appears as shown below. The search process used in searching the User Guide is similar to the [Global Search](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/search) functionality in Ilios. The starting point is shown below.

In the example shown above, the search term entered is "Add Session". You can see that many results were returned from that search. "Add New Session" is the first of the results returned. The others can located by scrolling down the page. The highest likelihood (best match) appears towards the top of the screen decreasing further down the page.

As the search criteria is further refined, the results returned will be fewer. The more specific the search criteria is, the fewer results you will have to scroll through to find what you want. They are sorted by best match. Click on any of the links to pull up the exact topic in detail.

Please contact us at [support@iliosproject.org](mailto:support@iliosproject.org) with any comments or suggestions you may have regarding this User Guide or about Ilios functionality in general.

The user guide is configured to have high level chapters based on the flyout menu items in the application, to be followed by a quick guide explaining how to perform common tasks in Ilios.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Navigation - On This Page</mark>

All pages within the guide that have bookmarks added by the author will have clickable links in an area on the right side of the screen called "ON THIS PAGE". An example of this is shown below.

## Working with Ilios

One important thing to remember: **Ilios is a web application.**

This application is web-based, meaning it must be accessed through web-browsing interfaces. While it may be used on any current web browser including Microsoft's Edge, Ilios is optimized for use with Mozilla’s Firefox web browser 32 and above, as well as all webkit-based web browsers such as Google Chrome (ver. 30.x and above) Safari (for Mac), or Opera (ver. 10.x and above).

Stick with the most recent releases in any of the browsers listed above, and Ilios will perform as expected. It can also be used on mobile phone browsers and most tablets.

## Saving Work

Work processed in Ilios is presented and collected in real-time, but is only saved to the system when a save event occurs. Much of the saving activity takes place automatically in real-time using in line editing or other user-friendly editing areas. This guide describes in detail how the save process occurs (ie. when you will need to manually save and when it takes place automatically). When there is work that is unsaved, action buttons will become active and should be used to process the save event before navigating away.

## Top-level Search

Ilios is designed to provide as much information as possible in a single display page. Ilios screens (Courses, Sessions etc.) allow for real-time text searching on multiple fields to make it easy to find the information you need.

## Optimal Viewing

Your primary view is that of an editor and content creator. In order to facilitate this complex view, the system currently works best on a high-resolution display monitor. Other views such as Learner views, and other non-content creation views, are usable at lower resolution, and can be viewed on smart phones and other handheld devices.

## Course Calendar

Ilios is built explicitly on the concept of user-centric information, rather than course-centric information. What this means is that the default view for a user entering the system is not an individual course, but the aggregate of all courses with which they are associated. As a course developer/ director, the maintenance of a single course and its sessions and offerings can easily be performed by selecting “Courses and Sessions” from the Ilios Menu.

## Ilios Workflow

The Ilios workflow is based on a curriculum structure which incorporates several interconnected levels (displayed below starting with a school's highest level -- program):

![Interconnected](images/introduction/inter_connected.png)

* A deployment of Ilios may include multiple related schools or institutions.
* Every school or institution creates and owns specific programs of study.
* Each program is divided into specific academic years.
* Each course managed is associated with a specific program or programs, via those years.
* Each course is made up of a number of sessions, or units.
* Each session or unit is "offered" at a specific time and location, or given a specific due date. These "offerings" are expressed as events on the calendar display, which provides access to detail information for users of the system.
* When working in Ilios, each of the levels maintains its state and changes do not cascade up or down.  This is so work can be done on each level independently and is a result of our wanting to provide as much information as possible on one screen.

## Logging In

Ilios allows for either native or enterprise authentication. Whether your institution uses Shibboleth authentication, basic LDAP, or CAS, Ilios provides configuration for this. If not, you may either modify the configuration of the authentication files to meet the needs of your system, or implement the native Ilios username/password authentication system.
