Once a program is created, other attributes may be added to that program by creating individual Academic Years. The Academic Year is a container for all curricular material for that particular year of the program. All additional program attributes are unique to each academic year of that program; attributes given to a program’s academic year and saved will be automatically copied to the next academic year, so it is best to create a single academic year, add its attributes, and then add further years as needed.
