# Multi-Day Offerings

Offerings that start on one day and continue on until the next or a future day are considered Multi-Day Offerings. They are tracked in a slightly different manner than other single day offerings. 

### How To Create a Multi-Day Offering

* Pull up a Course and create a Session
* Enter the Duration as shown in the screen shot below. Adjust the Offering's Duration until the correct End Date / Time is displayed.
