## Screen Shots with Field Descriptions

This had to be split into upper and lower portions to allow space to display the entire screen.

## Overview

The screen shot below shows the Courses and Sessions screen with the list of associated Sessions for a course. 

### Session List

![](../../.gitbook/assets/session_list1.png)

The screen shot above points out the icons indicating both the existence of pre-work learning events and instructional notes. The independent study session "A Video About Drugs" is due before the calendared session "Drug Taper".

It is easy to expand the Session List to allow for the maintenance of an Offering's room \(location\) right from this screen. Any Session's Title is a hyperlink and can be clicked to performance to a Session's attributes. After the list has been expanded, links to make changes to the attributes of an Offerings \(other than location\) right from the expanded Session List become available.

### Expand All Sessions

Expanding all Sessions for a Course as shown above results in the screen changing to something similar to what is shown below. A spinner will appear briefly while the list is being expanded.

### Expand Single Session

Any single \(or multiple\) session can be expanded if you choose to keep the remainder of the list in a non-expanded state. Only "ABC1 Exam Viewing" has been expanded in the screen shot shown below.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Sessions which have been selected to be an ILM \(Independent Learning Module\) are not expandable in this context because all information is already displayed.

### Session Detail

The session detail screen is very lengthy so in this situation, the top part is shown in the screen shot below.

Once a course has been saved, Sessions may be added to the course. A Session is a discrete instructional unit of curricular material or activity within a course. To add a new session, click “Add New”. This will create an empty Session, ready to be populated with the Session's attributes, listed [here](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/courses-and-sessions/sessions#session-attributes-all-session-types).
