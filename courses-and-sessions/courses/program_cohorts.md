The concept of program cohorts, described as "cohorts" is defined [here](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/glossary#cohort).

It is necessary to add at least one program cohort to any and all courses in order to select learner groups for offerings and ILM's along with mapping session and course objectives to graduation requirements (program year objectives / competencies).

# Add Cohort

If you have a new course that does not have any cohort attached at all. Usually rolled-over courses will already have a cohort attached as a part of the rollover process. Newly created courses will have a program year associated with them during the creation process; however, the program cohort must still be associated with / attached to the course.

This process is shown below on a newly created course.
