## Add Individual Learner to Group

In this example, there are no Learners in the group "Demonstration Group 05". The learner "Lawrence Alvarez" needs to be added to the group. This can be accomplished as shown below.

## Remove Learners from Group

### One Learner
Below is a screen shot depicting a learner group in "Manage" mode. Before any learners have been selected using the check boxes on the left, there are red indicators available to remove any one learner immediately. This happens without confirmation. As an example, the learner "Ann Cheryl Rose" will be removed from the learner group as soon as the red line is clicked.
