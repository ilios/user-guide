# Global Search

**NOTE**: Global Search is not currently available to users who are students and do not have any higher-level permissions or perform instructional or other non-learner functions in Ilios. This may change in the future.

![Global Search on the Dashboard](../images/global_search/global_search_start.png)

The search box is located at the location specified above. If fewer than three characters are entered, the search will not be performed. A `"keep typing..."` message will appear adviding that the minimum character entry has not been reached. After confirming a search by clicking on one of the suggedted values, the search box will move down to a more central location. Refer to [Search Results](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/dashboard/search#search-results).

The search provides content search to users with heightened privileges (non-students) across the curricula at your institution. Access beyond read-only for search returns is determined by individual permissions for each user account.

An entered search term will query across a broad array of areas within Ilios. These currently include:

* Course Title
* Course Objectives
* Course Learning Material Title
* Course Learning Material Description and Metadata
* Course Learning Material Content
* Course Vocabulary Terms
* Course MeSH Terms
* Session Title
* Session Description
* Session Objectives
* Session Learning Material Title
* Session Learning Material Description and Metadata
* Session Learning Material Content
* Session Vocabulary Terms
* Session MeSH Terms

Results are labeled according to the location of the match and listed with internal weighting to provide the most relevant results first.

After performing a search, all of the areas listed above are scanned for matches. Suggestions are also provided.

## Learning Material Contents

The newest addition to Ilios global search is that it now scans the complete text content of all Learning Materials in the system, along with curriculum data and metadata.

When you enter a search, the search results will be based not only on titles, terms, descriptions, and objectives in the curriculum; they will also take into account the complete text of associated learning materials, in order to provide a more robust and accurate results set.

Since content can often provide significantly more effective definition of learning focus, results which take this into account allow for a much more realistic analysis of the curriculum. Additionally, if descriptions of learning, or objectives for learning have begun to diverge from actual didactic activity, including LM content allows the easier identification and remediation of this effect.

## Performing a Search

To search for anything related to "brain", enter that into the search field provided. A list of suggested refinements ("Suggested Values") appear below the search box. Any of those can be utilized by clicking directly onto it.

To perform the full search (which we will do in this example), press the "Enter" key on the keyboard to perform the search.

## Search Results

The results of running a search for "brain" are demonstrated below.

## Cancel Search

To cancel any search after entering criteria, the keyboard's "escape" key (`esc`) can be utilized to clear out the search box value.

## Show More

Search results are grouped by Course, and then by Session. In the case above, the top three sessions that match (in order of match accuracy) are displayed. Clicking the "**Show More**" link, which appears at below the first three results for each Course, will open up and show the rest of the sessions within that course that match. For example, after the first "**Show More**" link located under the session link for "Defining the Mind", the screen now displays the rest of the sessions in the course called "Brain, Mind, and Behavior".

**NOTE:** This functionality is not available for students at this time.

## Filter Results

Once a search has been performed using the Global Search functionality, the results can be further refined (filtered). The following shows two types of filtering that can be done here.

### Filter By School

### Filter By Year

Use of one or both of the filters shown above will change the result set to only include the values which meet the selected specifications.
