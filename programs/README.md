# Programs

The Ilios Programs module allows for the creation and management of any number of unique programs of study for your institution. A program may be defined as a course of study which has 1 or more academic years of involvement, and in which learners matriculate and graduate as an identifiable group \(a “cohort” of learners\). An institution may have any number of programs.

This model allows for the greatest flexibility among institutions to manage programmatic curricula according to their own models and needs.

To create or edit a program, a user must have full edit privileges. First, access the Programs screen by selecting Programs from the Ilios menu.
