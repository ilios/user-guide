Once added into the cohort, these students can be placed in learner groups for that cohort or assigned directly to offerings as individual learners. These learner groups get assigned to offerings. Student calendars will get populated by either of these actions provided course and session are both published.

Refer to [Create New User](https://iliosproject.gitbook.io/ilios-user-guide/admin/create-new-user) for adding users to a cohort from your school's directory. For institutions not using a directory, students can be added to a Cohort upon setting up the user Account.
