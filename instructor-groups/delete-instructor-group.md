## Delete Instructor Group

Instructor groups can be deleted if they have never been attached to any Offerings or asynchronous learning activities. If an instructor group can be deleted (removed from system), the trash can icon will be enabled and ready to use. You will be prompted before performing this action. This is typical of Ilios functionality throughout the system.
