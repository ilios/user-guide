## Manage Emails

There is a section in the Schools functional area to maintain several important email addresses that pertain to any school's Ilios implementation.

### Administrator Email

This email has been set up to identify the administrator of your Ilios instance.

### Change-alert Recipients

This allows for the addition of one or more recipients who would like to receive change alert notification which are sent out automatically by the system when details (when, where, who) change especially regarding an offering location, instructor, or other pertinent details. The change-alert recipients will receive these email notifications.
